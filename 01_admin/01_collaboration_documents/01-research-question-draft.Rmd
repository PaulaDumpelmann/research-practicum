### Prelimiary Research Question

Does perceived corruption moderate individual predispositions to support or 
oppose redistribution? If yes, how? Using a novel survey data set gathered by 
Ferroni, Fisman and Golden, our research aims to untangle whether perceptions of 
corruption either weaken or strengthen the rationale for redistribution based on 
material and religious considerations. 

To address these aims, we pose two key research questions:

*1.	How do perceptions of corruption moderate the relationship between religiosity 
and redistributive preferences?*

We anticipate that, in line with the social underpinnings of Catholic doctrine, 
religious practitioners will be more inclined to support redistribution. 
Furthermore, we posit that (1) religious practitioners will express support for 
redistribution irrespective of their perceptions of corruption, driven by the 
moral aspect of religious practice.

Conversely, individuals who advocate for the inclusion of religion in politics 
are more likely to  exhibit tolerance for corruption and oppose redistribution. 
If the integration of religion into politics aligns with the pursuit of personal 
interests through public means, (2) these individuals are likely to normalize 
corruption and shy away from preferences that promote the welfare of "impersonal" 
others, such as redistribution.

*2.	How do perceptions of corruption moderate the relationship between income 
and redistributive preferences?*

Individuals hailing from lower-income backgrounds often face greater exposure 
to social risks suggesting that they have more to gain from redistributive 
policies. Consequently, one might expect them to be more inclined to support such 
policies. 

However, the effect of perceived corruption on this relationship could go in two 
distinct directions: On one hand, perceived corruption might erode trust in the 
efficiency and transparency of public institutions, (3) potentially leading to 
decreased support for redistribution. Conversely, perceived corruption could 
increase their concerns about relative wealth decline, (4) thereby increasing 
support for redistribution.
